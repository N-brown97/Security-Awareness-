Case project-2-1 Testing password strength.

Password 1) security.org stated my first password would take 42 minutes to crack

Password 2) Password-checker stated my password strength was " fairly good" 

Password 3) Passwordmeter.com would not work for me.. stated the page was unavailable.


During this case project, I realized that one of the similar passwords I used to rely on was not very strong. Deep down, I already knew it wasn’t the most secure choice, 
but I kept using it because it was easy to remember. After completing the project, I decided to go through my accounts and update them with stronger, more secure passwords.
What stood out to me the most was how the Security.org tool didn’t just label my password as “weak” or “strong.” Instead, it actually showed me how long it would take a computer to crack 
the password. Seeing those estimates made the risks feel more real and helped me understand why password strength is so important.
Out of the two resources I had access to, I found that Security.org provided the most useful and detailed information. 
It gave me a clearer picture of password security and reinforced the importance of creating unique, complex passwords for all of my accounts.


Summary- I learned that having any kind of online presence comes with the risk of being hacked or having your personal information stolen. 
No matter how careful you think you are, just being connected online makes you a potential target. 
One of the best ways to protect yourself is by creating strong, unique passwords and updating them regularly. This helps limit the chances of someone gaining access to your accounts.
I also learned how important it is to be cautious about where you share your information. Entering personal details on untrusted or suspicious websites can put you at serious risk. 
Once your information is out there, it’s almost impossible to take back, so it’s better to prevent the problem before it happens.
Overall, staying safe online comes down to being proactive: keeping your passwords secure, staying alert for threats, and protecting your personal information at all times.

Reflection- I’ve already gone through and updated my passwords to make them more unique and harder to crack. 
In the past, I tended to create a password once and then just leave it the same for long periods of time. 
Moving forward, I plan to change them more frequently to add an extra layer of security. 
By making my passwords stronger and regularly updating them, I’m taking steps to better protect my accounts and personal information.
