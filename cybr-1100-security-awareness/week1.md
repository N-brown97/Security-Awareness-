Summary- From module 1 I learned the key security goals and what each of them mean. CIA Confidentiality- Only those who are meant to see the information see it. 
Integrity- The data stays the same and does not get changed from one source going to another. Availability- The information needs to available to access when needed and those who need to see it can.
Realzing that the avaerage person is a lot more vaulerable to be hacked than what they may think. Proper ways to midigate being a victum of a cyber attack.
Case Project- [](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTpDnSznEyueE_oKujDXogD8qq0nxHm2kKUCm70I8cg/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
Reflection- These concepts relate to my personal experience in a way that im always connected to the internet and all of my information is either on my computer or phone which 
is always around people in public spaces. So at any point someone could get access to the data on my phone and get all my passwords, access to my credit cards/bank cards, get other people and companies contact information.
AI- I did use sage to help me create a table to reference for the case work as well as a recap of the of first module
